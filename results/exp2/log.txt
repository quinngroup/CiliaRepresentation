Exp2 Experiment Log:
=======================================================================================
Date: 2/11/2020
Model Architecture: NVP.py
Non-default arguments: Tests batch sizes of 10, 20, 40, and 80 with learning rate 1e-5.
Weights saved as bs[batch_size].h5
Logs saved under bs[batch_size]
=======================================================================================
Results: Enough variance in dataset that using low batch sizes to exploit induced variance seems unnecessary
Conclusion: Batch size 80 per card is recommended. Further testing in Exp7 recommended.
