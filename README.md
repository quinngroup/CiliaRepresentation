# Directory Structure
Top level directories correspond to **modules** in the project. These modules are designed to be developed in parallel with eachother. Of course, certain dependencies exist, such as the fact that the Appearance module may depend on results from the Processing module, however these do not completely restrict the development of modules in parallel. This is handled through branching. We use the following branches:

- **master**: contains the most recent *stable* build of the entire pipeline. 
- **candidate**: contains prototype pipeline composed of (hopefully) stable modules. Used to test module integration strategies and pipeline stability as a whole
- **processing**: contains prototype of processing module.
- **appearance**: contains the most recent *stable* build of the processing module and a prototype of the appearance module.
- **dynamics**: contains the most recent path dataset generated by the most recent *stable* appearance module (may optionally contain that module)
