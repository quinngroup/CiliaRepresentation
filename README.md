# Project Structure

## Directories
Top-level directories correspond to **modules** in the project. Within a module directory, top-level files should include the main driver file. Subdirectories should include:

- **exp**: a directory containing all experiment related information for the given module. Experiment data *must* include a `log.txt` file which documents the purpose of the expirement, the naming conventions employed by the experiment, and the corresponding conditions of each trial (e.g. learning rate of X corresponds to lrX.py). Experiment data *may include* stdout capture (either via bash redirection or through the tee command), recorded weights, tf-board event files or anything else deemed relevant.
- **test_builds**: a drirectory containing all 
The project modules are designed to be developed in parallel with eachother. Of course, certain dependencies exist, such as the fact that the Appearance module may depend on results from the Processing module, however these do not completely restrict the development of modules in parallel. This is handled through branching. 

## Branches
We use the following branches:

- **master**: contains the most recent *stable* build of the entire pipeline. 
- **candidate**: contains prototype pipeline composed of (hopefully) stable modules. Used to test module integration strategies and pipeline stability as a whole
- **processing**: contains prototype of processing module.
- **appearance**: contains the most recent *stable* build of the processing module and a prototype of the appearance module.
- **dynamics**: contains the most recent path dataset generated by the most recent *stable* appearance module (may optionally contain that module)

Child/sibling branches may spawn to sub-prototype any of the above branches (e.g. if there are two separate candidates that need to be tested)
